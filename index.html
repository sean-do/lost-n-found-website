					It’s a weird thing being a race different to the “norm” in the only country you’ve ever known. I think for a
					lot of immigrant children (or immigrants in general), a sense of

					is gained in your host country when you connect with others from your heritage culture, where together you can
					celebrate your unique ways of being and living.
				</p>
				<p>
					In my experience, gaining a sense of stability and connection hasn’t been so straightforward. Having grown up
					my whole life in Australia, there has always been a tension between simultaneous desires to feel “Australian
					enough” and “Chinese enough,” when the reality is that my identity is an inextricable combination of both
					cultures. Despite <a style="background-color: yellow">being</a> culturally disconnected from China – unable to
					speak the language and disengaged from most traditions from my parents’ respective hometowns – my parents’
					dispositions as people are fundamentally informed by their experiences growing up in China, and this has
					therefore fundamentally informed my own ways of being. This means that as connected as I feel to Australian
					and Western culture, there is a perpetual gap between me and the things I consume because of the context of my
					heritage. There are times where I question whether my consumption of Western media is wholly driven by genuine
					desire and enjoyment, or if a part of it can be attributed to an underlying, ever-present desire to conform
					and appease the Western standard. That is to say, a part of me feels that my engagement with Western culture
					is predicated on a desire to feel more Western, but of course no amount of engagement in a culture can
					compensate for your lack of heritage in said culture.
				</p>
				<p>
					As I grow older and meet more people with diverse backgrounds and relationships to their heritage and host
					cultures, I feel increasingly comfortable with this gap. Though labels and boxes can offer comfort and
					stability, they can also be restrictive and unconducive to developing an independent sense of self – that is,
					who you are beyond the conventions of labels that you may or may not resonate with. When I consider my life
					and who I am becoming as a person, I ultimately enjoy the fact that my engagement with the world is through
					the lens of my particular, somewhat unconventional relationship with culture – a position that doesn’t align
					me with one box or another. I enjoy it because it enables me to connect with a diverse array of people without
					needing the pretence of shared experience.
