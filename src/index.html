    Jen shares about her experience being caught between two worlds of never

      It’s a weird thing being a race different to the “norm” in the only
      country you’ve ever known. I think for a lot of immigrant children (or
      immigrants in general), a sense of

      and is gained in your host country when you connect with others from your
      heritage culture, where together you can celebrate your unique ways of
      being and living.

    <p>
      In my experience, gaining a sense of stability and connection hasn’t been
      so straightforward. Having grown up my whole life in Australia, there has
      always been a tension between simultaneous desires to feel “Australian
      enough” and “Chinese enough,” when the reality is that my identity is an
      inextricable combination of both cultures. Despite being culturally
      disconnected from China – unable to speak the language and disengaged from
      most traditions from my parents’ respective hometowns – my parents’
      dispositions as people are fundamentally informed by their experiences
      growing up in China, and this has therefore fundamentally informed my own
      ways of being. This means that as connected as I feel to Australian and
      Western culture, there is a perpetual gap between me and the things I
      consume because of the context of my heritage. There are times where I
      question whether my consumption of Western media is wholly driven by
      genuine desire and enjoyment, or if a part of it can be attributed to an
      underlying, ever-present desire to conform and appease the Western
      standard. That is to say, a part of me feels that my engagement with
      Western culture is predicated on a desire to feel more Western, but of
      course no amount of engagement in a culture can compensate for your lack
      of heritage in said culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I grow older and meet more people with diverse backgrounds and
      relationships to their heritage and host cultures, I feel increasingly
      comfortable with this gap. Though labels and boxes can offer comfort and
      stability, they can also be restrictive and unconducive to developing an
      independent sense of self – that is, who you are beyond the conventions of
      labels that you may or may not resonate with. When I consider my life and
      who I am becoming as a person, I ultimately enjoy the fact that my
      engagement with the world is through the lens of my particular, somewhat
      unconventional relationship with culture – a position that doesn’t align
      me with one box or another. I enjoy it because it enables me to connect
      with a diverse array of people without needing the pretence of shared
      experience.
