It’s a weird thing being a race different to the “norm” in the only country you’ve ever known. I think for a lot of immigrant children (or immigrants in general), a sense of {% highlight "comfort" %} and {% highlight "belonging" %} is gained in your host country when you connect with others from your heritage culture, where together you can celebrate your unique ways of being and living.

In my experience, gaining a sense of stability and {% highlight "connection" %} hasn’t been so straightforward. Having grown up my whole life in Australia, there has always been a {% bold "tension" %} between simultaneous desires to feel “Australian enough” and “Chinese enough,” when the reality is that my identity is an inextricable combination of both cultures. Despite being culturally {% bold "disconnected" %} from China – unable to speak the language and disengaged from most traditions from my parents’ respective hometowns – my parents’ dispositions as people are fundamentally informed by their experiences growing up in China, and this has therefore fundamentally informed my own ways of being. This means that as {% highlight "connected" %} as I feel to Australian and Western culture, there is a perpetual {% bold "gap" %} between me and the things I consume because of the context of my heritage. There are times where I question whether my consumption of Western media is wholly driven by genuine desire and enjoyment, or if a part of it can be attributed to an underlying, ever-present desire to {% bold "conform" %} and {% bold "appease" %} the Western standard. That is to say, a part of me feels that my engagement with Western culture is predicated on a desire to feel more Western, but of course no amount of engagement in a culture can compensate for your {% bold "lack" %} of heritage in said culture.

As I grow older and meet more people with diverse backgrounds and relationships to their heritage and host cultures, I feel increasingly {% highlight "comfortable" %} with this gap. Though {% bold "labels" %} and boxes can offer comfort and stability, they can also be restrictive and unconducive to developing an independent sense of self – that is, who you are beyond the conventions of labels that you may or may not resonate with. When I consider my life and who I am becoming as a person, I ultimately enjoy the fact that my engagement with the world is through the lens of my particular, somewhat unconventional relationship with culture – a position that doesn’t align me with one box or another. I enjoy it because it enables me to {% highlight "connect" %} with a diverse array of people without needing the {% bold "pretence" %} of shared experience.
