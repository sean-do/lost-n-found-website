      <h2>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</h2>
      <p>
        I acknowledge that this project is produced on the traditional lands of
        the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin nation. I pay my respects to their
        Elders past, present, and emerging.

      <h2>FOREWORD</h2>
      <p>
        This project started from a personal exploration of cultural identity
        and the complex relationship I have with my heritage culture. Past
        negative experiences had resulted in me carrying a sense of shame and
        disconnection, and even actively distancing myself from my cultural
        background. However, over time, being around a supportive community and
        gaining a deeper understanding of cultural diversity has helped me see
        cultural identities in more nuanced ways. I’ve slowly learned to accept
        myself and take pride in who I am, and in who I have become through
        these experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through lost'n found, I wanted to give back to the community. I want to
        create a resource that can help people relate.
