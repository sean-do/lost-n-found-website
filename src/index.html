      <h2>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</h2>
      <p>
        I acknowledge that this project is produced on the traditional lands of
        the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin nation. I pay my respects to their
        Elders past, present, and emerging.

      <h2>FOREWORD</h2>
      <p>
        This project started from a personal exploration of cultural identity
        and the complex relationship I have with my heritage culture. For a long
        time, past experiences had led me to carry a sense of shame and
        disconnection, and even actively distance myself from my cultural
        background. However, over time, being around a supportive community and
        gaining a deeper understanding of cultural diversity has helped me see
        cultural identities in more nuanced ways. I’ve slowly learned to accept
        myself and take pride in who I am, and in who I have become through
        these experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through lost &rsquo;n found, I want to create a platform where you can
        share your experience, find yourself reflected, and feel less alone in
        the journey of navigating belonging and cultural differences. Wherever
        you are on your journey, remember that you are beautiful and you are
        loved.
      </p>
